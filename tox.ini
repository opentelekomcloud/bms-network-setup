# The following are ignored on purpose. It's not super worth it to fix them.

# if they fix ALL of the occurances of one and only one of them.
# H306 Is about alphabetical imports - there's a lot to fix.
# H4 Are about docstrings and there's just a huge pile of pre-existing issues.
# W503 Is supposed to be off by default but in the latest pycodestyle isn't.
#      Also, both openstacksdk and Donald Knuth disagree with the rule. Line
#      breaks should occur before the binary operator for readability.
